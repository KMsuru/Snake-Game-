# Snake-Game-
This project is part of my Python learning journey, specifically Day 20, where I built a complete Snake Game using Python’s Turtle graphics module. The goal of this project was to understand animation, game loops, and Object-Oriented Programming in a practical and enjoyable way.

The game is structured into multiple Python files to keep the code organized. The snake.py file handles the creation of the snake, its movement, and body extension. The food.py file manages the food object that appears at random locations on the screen. The scoreboard.py file displays the player’s score and shows the “Game Over” message when the snake hits a wall or its own tail. Finally, the main.py file controls the game loop, event listeners, and collision detection between the snake, food, and walls.

Players control the snake using the arrow keys. Every time the snake eats the food, its length increases and the score updates on the screen. If the snake collides with the boundary or its own body, the game ends.

This project helped me improve my understanding of classes, methods, screen handling, and dynamic object movement in Python.
